This bot is for boxity-apps

## How to running the bots
Enter commands on terminal `ruby bot.rb`
Next, type bundle to install the gem dependencies, and then ruby bot.rb to start the bot running permanently.

Note: if youâ€™re accessing your server via SSH, youâ€™ll need to run the bot with `nohup ruby bot.rb &` to make sure the bot doesnâ€™t stop working when the SSH session is terminated. Now youâ€™re free to close the terminal window, safe in the knowledge that your bot is quietly beep booping away in the background. ðŸ¤–
